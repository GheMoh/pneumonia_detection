# Pneumonia Detection

## Introduction

Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. It is characterized by symptoms such as cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia can be caused by various factors, including viral or bacterial infections, other microorganisms, certain medications, and underlying health conditions. Diagnosing pneumonia often involves clinical examination, chest X-rays, blood tests, and sputum culture.

This project focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify X-ray images as "Pneumonia" or "Normal."

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Import and Understanding:** The project begins by importing necessary libraries and loading a dataset consisting of chest X-ray images categorized as "Pneumonia" or "Normal." This dataset is organized into training, testing, and validation sets.

2. **Data Visualization and Preprocessing:** The data is visualized to understand its distribution. Data preprocessing involves grayscale normalization and resizing the images to a consistent size (150x150 pixels). The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **Data Augmentation:** Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the dataset's diversity and prevent overfitting. These techniques include random rotations, zooming, shifting, and flipping of images.

4. **Model Architecture:** A CNN model is defined, consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, batch normalization, and dense layers. This architecture is designed to capture features from chest X-ray images and make predictions.

5. **Model Training:** The CNN model is trained on the augmented training data. The model's performance is monitored during training, and a learning rate reduction strategy is implemented to improve convergence.

6. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using the testing dataset. Metrics such as loss and accuracy are computed. Additionally, a classification report and a confusion matrix are generated to assess the model's performance in detail.

7. **Analysis and Visualization:** The project provides visualizations of training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs. It also showcases correctly and incorrectly predicted images for further analysis.

## Conclusion

The "Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)" project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model, trained on a dataset of labeled images, achieves a certain level of accuracy in classifying X-rays as "Pneumonia" or "Normal." The project highlights the significance of data preprocessing, data augmentation, model architecture design, and model evaluation in the context of medical image classification.

This application has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more efficiently, particularly when large volumes of X-ray images need to be analyzed. It showcases the intersection of computer vision and healthcare, contributing to the advancement of medical technology and patient care.
